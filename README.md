# DukeTheCube.github.io

This is the github repo for the for webisite for Cube, Duke's entrepreneurship SLG. The contents of this repo are taken from the _site folder from the Jekyll repo [here](https://github.com/DukeTheCube/CubeWebsite). 

The reason this is in a seperate repo is because there are a few complications with the plugins the Jekyll template (found [here](https://github.com/biomadeira/jasper)) uses. 

To figure out how to run the site locally, head on over to our other repo.
